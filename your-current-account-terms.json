Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) is defined as a hypothetical rate that shows what the interest rate would be if interest were paid and compounded annually. It's applicable to accounts that accrue credit interest.\n\n2. An arranged overdraft is a pre-agreed limit allowing account holders to borrow money up to a certain amount. The interest charged on this facility is referred to as arranged overdraft interest.\n\n3. A business day is defined as Monday to Friday, excluding bank holidays.\n\n4.

However, EAR does not account for any additional fees.\n\n6. The European Economic Area (EEA) comprises all European Union countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.\n\n7. The gross rate is the interest rate paid to the customer without any income tax deductions.\n\n8. An interest-free buffer on an arranged overdraft allows the use of the overdraft up to a certain limit without incurring interest charges.\n\n9. There is a monthly cap on charges for unarranged overdrafts, which limits the fees and interest for exceeding or not having an arranged overdraft. This cap includes fees for allowed and refused payments due to insufficient funds.\n\n10.

For example, if you opened your account on 15 August, your charging period will run from the 15th of each month to the 14th of the next month. You can find out your charging period by contacting us. The Effective Annual Rate of Interest (EAR) is the actual yearly cost of overdraft interest because it takes into account that we charge interest monthly. This means that you\u2019ll pay interest on any interest that has been added to your overdraft balance in the previous monthly charging period. It doesn\u2019t take account of any additional fees we may charge (for example, the Unpaid Transaction Fee). The European Economic Area (EEA) is a collection of countries. The countries in the EEA are all the countries in the European Union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. \u2022 The gross rate means the interest rate you\u2019re paid without the deduction of income tax. If your arranged overdraft has an interest free buffer, this means you can use your \u2022 arranged overdraft up to the value of your interest free buffer without needing to pay any arranged overdraft interest.\n\nMonthly cap on unarranged overdraft charges 1.

This cap covers any: (a) Interest and fees for going over/past your arranged overdraft limit; (b) Fees for each payment your bank allows despite lack of funds; and (c) Fees for each payment your bank refuses due to lack of funds.

When deciding if you have funds available and/or an available arranged overdraft to cover the withdrawal or payment, we\u2019ll exclude any debit card payments that have been approved but haven\u2019t been taken from your account yet.

The card will display a \u2018Debit\u2019 logo and can be used to make purchases in stores, over the phone or online and can be used to withdraw cash from cash machines. Some services let you create a digital copy of your debit card (for example, by adding your card to your mobile device to make contactless mobile payments or by saving your card details online to let you make payments more quickly). If you use your debit card in this way, any payments will be treated as if you used the physical card.

We may also enrol your replacement card with that card scheme\u2019s automatic updater service, which will securely update the details of your former card that are saved with a merchant to save you from individually updating the details with every merchant. We own any card issued by us, and you are not entitled to alter or modify the card or other payment instrument, yourself or through a third party, in any way. If we ask, you must return a cancelled card or other payment instrument.\n\n7.4 Charges for using your debit card Sometimes we\u2019ll charge you fees for using your debit card to access your money or to make payments.

To cancel a cheque, the account holder must request the cancellation before the cheque is presented for payment. Standing orders and Direct Debits can be canceled through contacting the branch, telephone banking, or online banking.

Additionally, the bank may use any refunds, compensation, or settlements owed to the customer to offset or reduce any overdue debts. If a customer has received a refund for a payment mistakenly claimed as erroneous (e.g., a Direct Debit) and the bank determines the refund was not justified, it reserves the right to reverse the refund and withdraw the amount from the customer's account.
