The patent describes methods for activating an enzyme, specifically error-prone or template-independent polymerases, through the alteration of pH levels using electricity. This process involves changing the pH of a reaction zone and site from a state at which the enzyme is inactive (inactivating pH) to a state at which it is active (activating pH). This activation allows the enzyme to add nucleotides to an initiator or a growing polymer chain. The activating pH can then be reverted to the inactivating pH, and this cycle can be repeated multiple times to synthesize a desired nucleic acid sequence.\n\nThe patent is detailed with 48 claims and includes nine drawing sheets illustrating the concept. Additionally, there is a mention of a specification that includes a Sequence Listing, indicating that specific nucleotide sequences relevant to the patent's methods are documented.

The method involves generating a specific pH within a reaction zone through the application of an electric current. This pH change activates an enzyme, which can then add nucleotide triphosphates to an initiator sequence, facilitating the enzymatic polymer synthesis of polynucleotides. The enzyme mentioned, such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), operates without the need for a template and can extend single-stranded nucleic acid templates with nucleotide triphosphates. The process can utilize a variety of nucleotide triphosphates, including naturally occurring and synthetic ones, under conditions where the enzyme is initially inactive. The activation of the enzyme is controlled by altering the pH at the reaction site through the application of an electric current, allowing the addition of nucleotide triphosphates to the initiator sequence or growing nucleic acid sequence. Multiple reactions can be conducted in parallel to produce a variety of nucleic acids.\n\nAdditionally, the text describes the schematic setup of an electrochemical cell used in these methods. This setup includes an anode and cathode adjacent to a substrate with attached initiators, and an aqueous electrolyte that contacts both the anode, cathode, and substrate. Applying voltage to the cell triggers an oxidation reaction at the anode, creating a reaction zone with a lowered pH that activates the enzyme for nucleotide addition at the reaction site. The enzyme can be deactivated by dispersing the generated acid or reversing the current to generate a base at the reaction zone.

This method involves the use of electricity to switch the pH of a reaction zone from a level that inactivates the enzyme to one that activates it, allowing for the controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing nucleic acid chain. This is achieved by applying a reagent or stimulus after each addition of a reversible terminator dNTP (deoxynucleotriphosphate), which chemically, physically, or enzymatically reverts the termination, enabling the sequential addition of the next desired dNTP.\n\nThe technology facilitates the precise addition of nucleotides, being limited to a specific number per cycle (e.g., one, two, three, or more nucleotides), through the enzyme's activation or inactivation by regulating the reaction zone's pH using electricity. This enables multiple rounds of nucleotide polymerization, with each round adding a different nucleotide to the initiator or primer, or to a growing nucleic acid oligomer or polymer.\n\nThe disclosed method specifically focuses on enzymatic synthesis of user-defined nucleic acid sequences using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT), a template-independent DNA polymerase. This approach offers improved control over the number and type of nucleotides incorporated into nucleic acid polymers by such polymerases, enabling the synthesis of user-defined nucleic acid sequences for various biological applications, including information storage using DNA. The invention thus represents a significant advancement in the field of synthetic biology and biotechnological applications of nucleic acid synthesis.###_### us10745814": ["lil(i 0 is a gel inm e of results of l)NA extension using 1'dl'n an electrochemical cell.\n\nUS 10,745,814 B2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nFIG. 9 depicts 3umod&lied rcvcrsiblc tennuxitors.

At these sites, initiator oligonucleotides, which are nucleic acids that serve as the starting point for enzyme-driven nucleotide extension processes, are immobilized. An electrode of an electrochemical cell is placed near or at the reaction site, and after the necessary reaction reagents are combined at this site, applying a voltage to the cell triggers oxidation or reduction. This change can either increase or decrease the initial pH within a reaction zone that encompasses the reaction site, which in turn can activate or deactivate the enzyme involved in the reaction.\n\nFurthermore, the method allows for the use of various types of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), including natural dNTPs, non-natural dNTPs, dNTP analogues, synthetic dNTPs, and specially modified dNTPs known as reversible terminator dNTPs.

These polymerases can be utilized to create nucleic acids de novo, meaning from scratch, without the need for a pre-existing template. The process involves using ordinary nucleotides (A, T/U, C, G) and can also incorporate nucleotides without chain-terminating moieties or use reversible terminators to facilitate the synthesis of nucleic acid sequences.\n\nThe text also describes a method for synthesizing oligonucleotide or polynucleotide sequences by attaching initiator sequences or primers to a substrate, such as silicon dioxide, in either a known arrangement (addressable array) or randomly. By applying reagents, including a selected nucleotide and a template-independent polymerase, at specific locations on the substrate where the initiator sequences are, and adjusting the pH conditions, the polymerase can be activated to add nucleotides to the initiator sequence, thus extending it. The initial pH is set to inactivate the polymerase, which is then altered to an activating pH where the polymerase becomes active. Controlling the polymerase activity through pH adjustments is a key aspect of this method, with the text noting that the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme, for example, is active below pH 10 but inactive at pH 11. Therefore, adjusting the pH from an initial inactive state (e.g., pH 11) to an active state (below pH 10) can activate the TdT enzyme to facilitate the nucleotide polymer synthesis process.\n\nThe described technology underscores the ability to control the synthesis of nucleic acid sequences through the use of modified or template-independent polymerases and pH adjustments, enabling the creation of specific polynucleotide sequences for various applications in genetic and molecular biology research.

This can be done through periodic applications of the nucleotides, which may include nucleotides with blocking groups or reversible terminators. These special nucleotides are used under specific reaction conditions that limit or reduce the likelihood of multiple dNTPs being added at once, thus allowing for precise control over the nucleic acid synthesis process.\n\nOne key aspect of the method is the use of polymerase enzymes under conditions where their activity can be electrochemically modulated. By applying a voltage within a suitable environment, the polymerase can be activated or deactivated, facilitating the addition of a single dNTP or preventing the addition of extra dNTPs. This electrochemical control is achieved through oxidation or reduction reactions that alter the pH, which in turn affects the activity of the polymerase.\n\nThe method also involves introducing and removing various reaction reagents at the reaction site or within the reaction zone. This can include washing steps to remove certain reagents before introducing new ones. The application of reagents can be performed in different ways, such as depositing, flowing, spotting, or spraying, either to specific locations or across the entire support surface.\n\nOverall, the described technique allows for the controlled addition of dNTPs to synthesize desired nucleic acids with precision, utilizing a combination of special nucleotides, electrochemical modulation of polymerase activity, and careful management of reaction reagents.

The extension rate of a primer in the presence of these metal ions is ranked in the order of Mg2+ > Co2+ > Zn2+ > Mn2+. Each ion has a different impact on the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation. For example, Mg2+ promotes the preferential use of dGTP and dATP, Co2+ increases the catalytic efficiency for the pyrimidines dCTP and dTTP, and Zn2+ acts as a positive effector for TdT, enhancing reaction rates when micromolar quantities are added.

The process involves manipulating the pH at the reaction site to control the activity of the DNA polymerase. Initially, the reaction site is set at an inactivating pH that prevents the DNA polymerase from adding nucleotide triphosphates to the initiator sequence. The reaction site is situated within a reaction zone that includes an electrode, which can function as either an anode or a cathode within the electrochemical cell.\n\nThe method consists of several key steps:\n\n1. **Applying Voltage:** By applying voltage to the electrochemical cell, an acid or base is generated in the aqueous electrolyte media at the reaction zone. This alters the pH to create an activating pH that enables the DNA polymerase to function, allowing it to add one or more selected nucleotide triphosphates to the 3'-terminal nucleotide. The conditions are tailored such that the added nucleotide triphosphate becomes a new 3'-terminal nucleotide, and a desired number of nucleotide triphosphates are added to the initiator sequence.\n\n2. **Repeating the Process:** These steps (a) and (b) are repeated until the desired polynucleotide sequence is synthesized.\n\nThe disclosure also details specific aspects of the electrochemical setup and the pH manipulation:\n\n- The electrode within the reaction zone can be an anode or a cathode. When a voltage is applied between the anode and cathode, acid is generated at the anode.\n- The aqueous electrolyte media may include acid-generating reagents, weakly acidic moieties that release protons upon oxidation, or weakly basic moieties that release hydroxide ions upon reduction, all of which participate in adjusting the pH at the reaction site.\n- The inactivating pH is defined as equal to or more than 11 for deactivating the polymerase, and the activating pH is less than 11. Alternatively, the inactivating pH can be equal to or below 4, with the activating pH being greater than 4.\n\nFurther, the method includes returning the reaction zone to an inactivating pH after each cycle of nucleotide addition, which can be achieved by adding a base or an acid to the reaction zone, depending on the desired inactivating pH level.\n\nOverall, this disclosure presents a sophisticated technique for polynucleotide synthesis involving electrochemical control of pH to regulate the activity of a DNA polymerase in a precise and controlled manner.###_### us10745814": ["wherein the reaction site is at an inactivati\u00bbg pH tlmt renders the error pmne or template independent DNA poly- mcrasc inactn c lo add lhe selected nuclcolxlc lriphosphate to Ihe initiator scqucncc, and whereu& Ihc reaction sile &s within a reaction zone including an electrode of an electro- chemical cell where&n the electmde is an anode or a cathode in of the electrochemical cell, (b) applying voltage to the electrochemical cell to generate an acid or a base in the aqueous electrolyte media at the reaction zone to alter pH in Ihe reaction zone lo create an aclivalu&g pH lo actn dlc thc template indcpcniknl DNA polymcrasc, error prone or wherein reactinn reagents are present at selected concentra- tions and under conditions which covalently add one or more of the selected m&cleotide triphosphate to the 3'er- minal nucleotide such that the celected nucleotide triphos- phate becomes n 3'erminal nucleotide and under condirions Ic w hcrcu& d desired number ol'he sclectcd mi rico talc Iriphos- phatc &s added lo thc u\u00bbus&or scqucnce, and (c) repealing steps (a) and (b) until the polynucleotide is tbrmed qhe disclosure provides that the electmde within the reaction zone is an anode 'I'he disclosure provides that the electrode ivithin the reaction zone &s a cathode.

This site is designed to have a pH that inactivates the DNA polymerase to prevent it from adding the nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence prematurely.\n\n2. **pH Adjustment via Electrochemical Cells**: The reaction site is part of a reaction zone that includes an electrode of an electrochemical cell, which can function as either an anode or a cathode. By applying a voltage or current to the electrochemical cell, an acid or a base is generated within the aqueous electrolyte medium at the reaction zone. This alteration in pH creates an activating environment for the DNA polymerase, thereby enabling it to become active and add the selected nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence.\n\nThe innovative aspect of this method lies in its precise control over the enzymatic activity of the DNA polymerase through pH adjustments made possible by electrochemical cells. This allows for the targeted addition of nucleotides to the initiator sequence, facilitating the synthesis of polynucleotides in a controlled manner. The patent highlights the invention's capability to provide multiple reaction zones and corresponding electrochemical cells, enabling the simultaneous synthesis of different polynucleotides under controlled conditions.###_### us10745814": ["cagtcagatc ggaagagcac acgtctgaac tccagtca\n\n3 ~\n\n55\n\npH that renders the ermr prone or template independent DNA polymemqse inactive to add the selected nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence. and wherein each I'0;lctlon site Ls lvlthul a cori'esponlhng I'cacthul zilne lnchlrl- ing ml cleclrodc ol a corresponding ehmlrochcmical cell whermn thc clcctrode ls an anode or a cathode of thc electrochemical cell thereby providing a plurality ofreaction zones snd a plurahly of corrcspondulg clectrochmnlcal cells, (b) applying separate voltages to each of thc corresponding clctxrochcmicsl cells to generate an selt) or a base in the ss aqueous electrollae media at the corresponding, reaction zone to alter pi I in the corresponding reaction zone to create\n\nThe invention claimed is: 1 A method fhr making 0 polynucleotlde comprising (aj combining a selected nucleotide triphosphate, one or more cations, and an error pmne polymerase or tem- plate indtqicndent DNA polymerase ul aqueous clcc- lrolytc mcdla al a renclion elle lncludulg an ulilialor sequence attached thereto and having a y terminal nucleonic,\n\nwhcrcul the reacnon sile is at an ulacuvatlng pH lhal rmldcrs the error prone polymcrasc or lcmplalc inde- pendent l)NA polymerase inactive to add the selected nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence, and\n\nUS 10,745,814 B2\n\n23 v;hcrchl Ihc rcacnon site ls wlthul d lcdcllon zone ulclUd- ing an electmde of an electrochemical cell wherein the clcctrodc is au anode or a cathode of Ihe eleclrochenu- cal cell,\n\n(b) dpplyulg voltugc or current to the electrochemical cell to enerate an ac&d or a base in the aqueous electrolyte media at the reaction zone to alter pH in the reaction zone to create an activating pi I to activate the error prone polymerase or template independent DNA poly- nlcrB sc,\n\n10###_### us10745814"], "The text outlines a detailed method concerning a specific type of DNA polymerization process.

PCR is a common technique used in molecular biology to amplify DNA.\n\nOn the right side, the molecular structure seems to have undergone a reaction, as indicated by the \"OH\" at the end of the pentagon, suggesting that it has been reduced or has gained electrons/hydrogen. The phosphate backbone also appears to have been affected, as it now shows a broken bond or a missing oxygen atom in the second phosphate group, which could represent a cleavage or a specific reaction that has taken place.\n\nOverall, the image is likely depicting a step in a PCR process or a related reaction involving nucleic acids, where heat and a PCR buffer cause a change in the molecular structure, which could be related to DNA denaturation, modification, or some form of nucleic acid processing.###_### us10745814"], "The image shows a series of six chemical structures, each labeled with both a name and an abbreviation.
