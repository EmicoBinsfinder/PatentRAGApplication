This system includes a quasi-feedforward path controller and a model predictive control (MPC) feedback controller, both of which are communicatively coupled to the path planning controller.\n\nThe quasi-feedforward path controller receives input values that include curvature data and front steer angle data.

The purpose of this controller is to provide an initial steer angle command that anticipates the vehicle's required steering action to follow a desired path, even when the primary steering control might be compromised.\n\nThe MPC feedback controller receives the feedforward rear steer angle command, front steer angle, desired path data, and vehicle sensor data. It then calculates a final steer angle command by integrating the feedforward rear steer angle command with real-time data about the vehicle's position, direction, and the intended path.

This setup is designed to ensure the autonomous vehicle can navigate safely and accurately, even in situations where the primary electric power steering system fails or when the vehicle needs to be controlled at higher lateral accelerations or through rapidly changing speeds.\n\nThe background section emphasizes the need for a robust controller capable of adjusting to dynamic variability, such as driver interference, computational fluid dynamics not holding the front steer, high road load, etc. This technology is critical for maintaining the autonomous vehicle's ability to sense its environment and navigate with minimal user input, especially under challenging conditions.###_### US10196086": ["vehicles .\n\ning controller communicatively coupled to the path planning\n\nBACKGROUND\n\ncontroller , the quasi - feedforward path controller configured\n\nto : receive input values comprising the curvature data and\n\nAn autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of ,\n\nfront steer angle data ; and compute a feedforward rear steer\n\nsensing its environment and navigating with little or no user\n\nangle command , based on the input values ; a model predic\n\ninput .

Autonomous vehicles, defined as vehicles capable of navigating with minimal to no human input by sensing their environment, face challenges during situations like electric power steering failures. In such scenarios, these vehicles must rely on secondary steering mechanisms to maintain control. The document highlights the complexities involved in controlling an autonomous vehicle during such failures, including the need to manage higher lateral accelerations and rapidly changing longitudinal speeds. Additional challenges may arise from the front steer moving independently due to factors like driver intervention, failure in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to maintain front steer, or high road load conditions.\n\nGiven these challenges, there is a clear need for a robust control system capable of adapting to the dynamic and transient nature of these problems. The document outlines the desirability of developing improved steering control techniques for autonomous vehicles, as well as the integration of these techniques into methods, systems, and vehicles.

During an electric power steering failure, an autono- mous vehicle will need to be controlled using a secondary steer mechanism. Due to the transient nature of the problem, the autonomous vehicle may need to be controlled at a higher lateral acceleration and/or through a rapidly changing longitudinal speed. In addition, the front steer may be moving due to a driver co-opting steer control, computa- tional fluid dynamics (CFD) not holding the front steer, high road load, or the like. A robust controller with the capability to adjust for such dynamic variability may be required, to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nAccordingly, it is desirable to provide techniques for improved control of steering for autonomous vehicles.

These data points are integrated via a sensor fusion algorithm to predict the coordinates of a theoretical center line of the current lane, formulated as a polynomial equation.\n\nSubsequently, process 200 computes a feedforward rear steer angle using the input trajectory data, which encompasses curvature, heading, and lateral offset data, along with the vehicle's longitudinal acceleration and front steer angle. This calculation aids in determining a desired path for the vehicle.\n\nFollowing this, the process calculates a feedback signal for the rear steer angle. This involves collecting vehicle sensor data, including the vehicle's lateral velocity and yaw rate, and calculating additional parameters such as the feedforward rear steer angle, heading data, lateral offset data, front steer angle, a real-time cost function, and real-time state space matrices. An integral state is also calculated to accumulate lateral offset error. At this stage, the front steer is fixed, and the feedback signal is determined using the collected sensor data, computed parameters, and the lateral offset error. This comprehensive process underscores the complex interplay of data and calculations required for autonomous vehicle navigation.###_### US10196086": ["Next, the process 200 obtains input trajectory data for autonomous operation of the vehicle (step 204).

The predicted trajectory coordinates are provided to downstream control- lers as a polynomial y=f(x), in the current vehicle coordi- nates.\n\nThe process 200 then calculates a feedforward rear steer angle, based on the input trajectory data (step 206). Here, the process 200 calculates a desired path (i.e., a theoretical trajectory) for the vehicle, which includes curvature data, heading data, and lateral offset data, based on the input trajectory data. The process 200 also obtains a longitudinal acceleration for the vehicle, and a front steer angle for the vehicle, and calculates the feedforward rear steer angle using the curvature data, a longitudinal acceleration, and a front steer angle.\n\nNext, the process 200 calculates a feedback signal of the tear steer angle (step 208).
