{"US Patent Application Publication US 2018/0193694 A1, published on July 12, 2018, by Rick C. Bergman of Grafton, WI, introduces a system for identifying the location of athletic equipment and playing fields using RFID technology. The invention, filed on January 8, 2018, with a provisional application filed on January 6, 2017, aims to improve the tracking and management of athletic equipment by embedding RFID chips within the equipment. These RFID chips contain electronic circuits capable of generating and emitting RF signals.\n\nThe innovative system comprises one or more pieces of athletic equipment, each equipped with an RFID chip. Additionally, an array of sensors is deployed on or near the athletic playing surface to detect the RF signals emitted by the RFID chips. This arrangement allows for precise determination of the positions of the equipped athletic equipment on the playing field.\n\nThe application outlines the use of RFID-based technology to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of location identification in sports settings, improving the overall management and experience of athletic activities.###_### US20180193694A1": ["US 20180193694A1\n\n( 19 ) United States\n\n( 12 ) Patent Application Publication ( 10 ) Pub .

This patent relates to the use of RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology for location identification in athletic equipment and playing fields. The core issue it aims to address is the problem of inaccurate calls made by officials during sports games, particularly football, due to their positioning and the angle of view. Even video replay technology, which is often relied upon to confirm or overturn calls, can produce incorrect decisions or inconclusive evidence due to the positioning of cameras around the playing field.\n\nThe text mentions that players often attempt to subtly reposition the football after a play has ended, which officials might not always detect. This can lead to incorrect decisions regarding goal lines or first downs, significantly impacting the game's outcome. The patent application references a prior provisional patent application (Ser.

The core of this invention is the use of electronic chips or RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tag circuits embedded within the football and other athletic equipment like footwear or kneepads. These embedded chips are designed to transmit signals that represent data indicating whether the football has moved out of bounds, if a ball carrier has touched the ground and should be ruled down, or other critical in-game situations.\n\nSpecific details of the invention include embedding RFID tag circuits within various parts of the football, such as on or within the bladder, the cover (both inner and outer surfaces), beneath the lacing for protection, and within other components like winding layers and padding. This strategic placement allows for the sensing of each end and surface of the football, which assists in accurately determining the ball's position on the field, such as whether it has crossed the goal line or reached a first down marker.\n\nAdditionally, the invention extends to player equipment, with a focus on shoes as an exemplary embodiment. Shoes can have electronic chips/RFID tag circuits embedded in several locations, including the top-front, heel, and outer edge/side, with antennas embedded along the sides for positional determination relative to out-of-bounds lines on the field. This technology can either be integrated during the manufacturing process to ensure water tightness or added later by installing the tag circuits into specially designed pockets within the shoe.\n\nOverall, this invention aims to provide more accurate and reliable data for making critical decisions during football games by leveraging RFID technology to monitor the position of the ball and players in relation to the field's boundaries and other relevant markers.###_### US20180193694A1": ["movement of the football 10 and / or equipment with respect\n\nstepped out of bounds during a play and / or if a ball carrier\n\nto the field .

In football, the chips in the ball and possibly other equipment, when used with a monitoring system, can precisely determine the position of the ball and players on the field. This allows for accurate calls on whether the ball crossed goal lines, achieved first downs, or if a player went out of bounds, among other critical game events. \n\nFor tennis, the technology addresses the challenge of accurately judging whether a ball is in or out of bounds during matches. The high speed of tennis balls and their proximity to boundary lines often make it difficult for umpires and line judges to make accurate calls. By embedding a chip in the tennis balls and employing a monitoring system on the court, the technology can detect when the ball touches a boundary or service line, thereby aiding the umpire in making more accurate decisions.\n\nOverall, the invention aims to enhance the integrity and accuracy of officiating in sports, providing officials, leagues, and fans with more reliable information regarding key moments in games.

In rugby, the electronic chip/RFID tag circuit is integrated into the rugby ball to help determine whether the ball passes through the goal posts during a drop goal attempt, a task that can be challenging for referees. This technology, along with a monitoring system placed within the field, could accurately sense the ball's position relative to the goal posts and the boundary lines, thereby aiding referees in making more accurate decisions. The same principle applies to football, where the technology embedded in the ball and possibly in players' equipment could significantly reduce the need for replay reviews by providing precise information on the ball's position during the game. This could minimize incorrect calls that might affect the game's outcome, ensuring a fairer and more accurate assessment of plays even if the view of the officials or replay cameras is obstructed or unclear. The document suggests that incorporating such technology could improve the efficiency and accuracy of decision-making in sports, potentially transforming how games are officiated.###_### US20180193694A1": ["[0041] In still another embodiment, the electronic chip/ RFID tag circuit(s) 18 may be employed in a rugby match.

TRANSMITTER - This block is responsible for sending out signals, which are likely passed to or from the antenna.\n3. RECEIVER - This block is intended to receive signals, which are also likely connected to the antenna.\n4. PROCESSOR - This is the central unit that would process data and control the operation of the system.\n5. TRANSCEIVER - This block typically combines the functions of a transmitter and receiver, suggesting the system can both send and receive signals.\n6. MEMORY - This block represents the storage component where data or program instructions might be kept.\n7. POWER SUPPLY - This block provides electrical power to the system.\n\nThe lines between the blocks illustrate the interconnections that allow these components to interact. For example, the processor is connected to the transmitter, receiver, memory, and power supply, which indicates it controls these components. The transceiver is directly connected to the processor, showing that it also communicates with the processor.\n\nHowever, due to the quality and style of the image, specific details such as the nature of the device, the exact functionalities, or the context in which it is used are not discernible.###_### US20180193694A1"], "The image you've provided appears to be a black and white line drawing or sketch of a shoe.
