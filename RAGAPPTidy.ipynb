      "To use pH alternation to intermittently activate an enzyme for the purpose of adding a nucleotide to a polymer chain, you can follow a method based on the principles outlined in the provided context. This method involves using electricity to alter the pH at a reaction zone and reaction site, transitioning from an inactivating pH, where the enzyme is inactive, to an activating pH, where the enzyme becomes active and can add a nucleotide to an initiator or growing polymer chain. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the disclosed information:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preparation of the Reaction Site**: Combine a selected nucleotide triphosphate (the building block of the nucleic acid polymer you wish to synthesize), one or more cations, and an enzyme (such as an error-prone or template-independent DNA polymerase) in an aqueous electrolyte media at a reaction site. This site should include an initiator sequence attached to a substrate, which acts as the starting point for the polymer chain extension.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Setting the Initial pH**: Ensure that the initial conditions at the reaction site are at an inactivating pH. This pH level renders the enzyme inactive, preventing it from adding the nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence prematurely.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Application of Electricity to Alter pH**: Utilize an electrochemical cell, which includes electrodes (an anode or a cathode) positioned adjacent to the substrate with the initiator sequence. By applying voltage or current to the electrochemical cell, you can induce oxidation or reduction reactions. These reactions generate an acid or a base in the aqueous electrolyte media, altering the pH within the reaction zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Activating the Enzyme**: Adjust the pH to an activating level by the generated acid or base. This activating pH enables the enzyme to become active and add the nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence or the growing polymer chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Reverting the pH to Inactivate the Enzyme**: After a nucleotide has been added, revert the pH back to the inactivating level. This can be achieved by stopping the application of electricity, allowing diffusive dispersion of the generated acid or base, or by reversing the current to generate the opposite effect (acid to base or base to acid) at the reaction zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Repeat the Process**: The process of alternating the pH to activate and inactivate the enzyme can be repeated as many times as desired.
