The football is shown in a three-dimensional perspective, with the traditional stitching and shape visible.\n\nThere are several notable features in the drawing:\n\n1. The top of the football has an openable flap or section, presumably for accessing the interior of the ball. This feature is indicated by dotted lines, suggesting that it may be a movable or removable part.\n2. There are additional lines and shapes drawn inside the football, which might represent internal components or modifications not typical of a standard football.\n3. To the right of the football, there are curved lines that could indicate motion or some form of interaction with the environment, possibly relating to the ball's trajectory or the effect of the internal mechanisms on its movement.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to determine the exact purpose of the modifications or the intended use of this design. The additional features could be related to technology, sensors, or other innovations intended to enhance the functionality of the football beyond its standard use in sports.###_### US20180193694A1": ["The image appears to be a line drawing from a patent application, showcasing a design that resembles an American football with some additional elements.
