The background section highlights the current challenges in DNA synthesis, notably the inefficiency, slowness, and high cost associated with traditional chemical synthesis methods that use phosphoramidite precursors in organic solvents. These methods, which have an error rate of about 1% and take roughly 10 minutes per addition step, also involve expensive reagents that can damage the DNA, limiting the synthesis to strands shorter than approximately 200 bases. This inefficiency is a significant barrier to using DNA as a storage medium for digital information.

The core idea is to use an electric current to generate a specific pH within a reaction zone of the cell, which in turn activates an enzyme capable of adding nucleotides to a nucleic acid sequence without the need for a template strand. This enzymatic process is referred to as enzymatic polymer synthesis. \n\nOne example of such an enzyme mentioned is terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), which can extend single-stranded nucleic acid templates by adding nucleotide triphosphates. The method allows for the incorporation of various nucleotides, including natural ones like A, T, C, G, and synthetic or modified nucleotides, into an initiator sequence or an existing nucleic acid chain. The activation of the enzyme is controlled by the pH, which is altered using an electric current within the reaction zone. This process can be carried out in parallel, enabling the production of multiple nucleic acid sequences simultaneously.\n\nThe document also describes the assembly of an electrochemical cell used in these methods, including its components like an anode, cathode, and a substrate with initiator sequences attached. Application of voltage to the cell induces an oxidation reaction at the anode, generating acid that lowers the pH in the reaction zone, hence activating the enzyme for nucleotide addition. The enzyme can be deactivated by dispersing the acid or reversing the current to generate a base, thus modifying the pH again.\n\nFigures included in the text provide schematics of the electrochemical cell setup, the assembly of such a cell, and the positioning of the anode and cathode in relation to the substrate with initiators. There are also gel images showing the results of DNA extension using the method, and figures depicting modified and unmodified reversible terminators and base-modified nucleotides, which are likely related to the specific modifications of nucleotides used in the enzymatic synthesis process.\n\nThe document, identified by the US patent number 10,745,814 B2, essentially presents a novel approach to synthesizing polynucleotides using electrochemical cells to control the enzymatic activity by altering pH, offering a potentially efficient and versatile method for generating nucleic acids for various applications.###_### us10745814": ["SUMIVLasRY\n\nFI(i 5 is a schcmanc ol'ouble salad Bdhcsivc frames used In the manufidciurc of an electrochemical cell for use in the niethods described herein\n\nlite prcsmit disclosure Is directed Io Ihc usc of an electric current to gcncmtc a pH within a reaction zone IhaI aciivaIcs an enzyme, such as mi error prone or ImnplaIe independent to add a nucleotide. such as a nucleotide polymerase. triphosphate. to an mitiator 1'his method allov s the produc- tion of one or more polynucleotides using enzymatic poly- mer synthesis For example, an enzyme such as terminal dixixynuclcotidyl transfi:rase (TdT) (wluch extends suiglc stranded nucleic acid tcmplatcs with nuclcondc Iriphos- phaies without use of a Imnplaic) Is combuuxl with one or 'I'/lJ (dAI 9, more micleotide triphosphates such as A.

This technique involves alternating the pH of the reaction zone between levels that activate and inactivate the enzyme, thereby allowing precise control over the addition of nucleotides during DNA synthesis. The process can be repeated multiple times to achieve the desired sequence length and composition. The methods utilize various types of dNTPs, including natural, non-natural, analogues, synthetic, and reversible terminator dNTPs, to facilitate the synthesis of user-defined nucleic acid sequences. This approach is especially useful for template-independent polymerases like terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), offering improved control over the number and type of nucleotides incorporated into the nucleic acid polymers. The disclosed methods can be applied in biological applications and information storage using DNA. The technology includes fluidic or microfluidic devices that may be computer-controlled to manage the addition and removal of reagents or buffers to a reaction site, where initiator oligonucleotides are immobilized. Applying voltage to an electrochemical cell at the reaction site causes oxidation or reduction reactions that adjust the pH, thereby modulating enzyme activity.

These polymerases can create nucleic acids de novo using ordinary nucleotides like A, T/U, C, or G, and may operate without needing chain-terminating moieties. The process can also incorporate reversible terminators to control the synthesis of nucleic acid sequences.\n\nThe synthesis involves attaching oligonucleotide sequences or primers to a substrate, such as silicon dioxide, in an array that can be either addressable or random. The synthesis process is controlled by applying reagents, including a selected nucleotide and a template-independent polymerase, to the substrate where the initiator sequences are located. The polymerase's activity is regulated by the pH condition of the reaction, with the polymerase being inactive at a certain pH (inactivating pH) and becoming active when the pH is adjusted to within its active range. For instance, the Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase (TdT) enzyme is highlighted as being active below pH 10 and inactive at pH 11. Therefore, adjusting the reaction's pH from 11 to below 10 can temporarily activate the enzyme.\n\nThe method allows for the controlled addition of nucleotides to the initiator sequence by applying them in periodic applications and using blocking groups or reversible terminators to limit the enzymatic addition of nucleotides. This control over the polymerase's activity can also be achieved through electrochemical modulation, where an applied voltage in an electrochemical cell environment alters the pH to activate or deactivate the polymerase, thus influencing the addition of nucleotides.\n\nIn summary, the text outlines a sophisticated method for the synthesis of nucleic acid sequences using error-prone or template-independent polymerases, with precise control over the sequence assembly process achieved through pH adjustments and electrochemical modulation, enabling the creation of nucleotide polymers with specific sequences.###_### us10745814": ["la\n\n15\n\nio\n\n25\n\nPolymerases. including without limitation error-prone or template-dcpm&dm&t polymerases. modilicd or o&herw&sc, can bc uscxf &o crea&e nuclcoude polymers having a random or knovn or desired sequence of nucleotides qemplate- independent polymerases. whether modified or otherwise, can be used to create the nucleic acids de novo.

TdT is distinguished by its ability to utilize a variety of divalent metal ions for catalysis, including Co2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+, each affecting the polymerization rate and nucleotide incorporation kinetics differently. For instance, Mg2+ promotes the use of dGTP and dATP, while Co2+ enhances the efficiency of incorporating pyrimidine nucleotides. Zn2+ can stimulate reaction rates by potentially inducing conformational changes in TdT, increasing catalytic efficiency. Conversely, Mo2+ is less efficient compared to Mg2+ in supporting the reaction.\n\nMoreover, the text mentions the possibility of modulating nucleotide attachment by substituting the divalent metal ions with other cations, which may regulate whether a nucleotide will incorporate or not. This technique can be used to create nucleic acid sequences de novo, leveraging polymerases' ability to incorporate nucleotides independently of the template sequence. This approach is beneficial for generating specific nucleic acid sequences and can be employed for information storage in nucleic acid sequences, taking advantage of both RNA and DNA polymerases, including those that are error-prone for specific base incorporation.\n\nAdditionally, the text references standard treatises and texts in the field of nucleic acid chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology, indicating the scientific context and foundation of the discussed concepts.###_### us10745814": ["like ail DNA polymemsses, also requires divalent metal iona for catalysis.

This polymerase can operate in the presence of all four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and its mutation rate may increase when limited to one or two dNTPs. This enzyme is likened to a de novo recorder of nucleic acids, similar to terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) but with the advantage that its product is continuously double-stranded, which has less complex secondary structure and is more predictable than single-stranded DNA.

The alternative base pairs are designed to be compatible with both natural and mutant polymerases for both de novo synthesis and amplification of genetic material.\n\nKey research and developments in this area are highlighted through several references. For instance, a study by Betz et al. in 2012 demonstrated that the KlenTaq polymerase can replicate unnatural base pairs by inducing a Watson-Crick geometry, indicating the potential for these base pairs in genetic replication processes. Other referenced works include research by Switzer et al. in 1993 on the enzymatic recognition of the base pair between isocytidine and isoguanosine, and studies by Yang et al. and Malyshev et al. on the amplification, mutation, and sequencing of synthetic genetic systems that incorporate these unnatural base pairs.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions that certain nucleotide analogues have shown equal or superior efficiency, rate, and length distribution compared to their natural counterparts in experimental settings, although specific details about these analogues and their performance are not provided.\n\nOverall, the incorporation of alternative base pairs into oligonucleotides represents a promising advancement in the field of synthetic biology, with potential applications in data storage, genetic engineering, and the development of safer and more efficient biotechnological tools.###_### us10745814": ["Alternatives to standard DNA base pairs or RNA base pairs in ihe oligouuclcondes of Ihc preen(1 disclosure can pmvide hi her density in hits per cubic mm, higher safety (rosie(an( Io accidmiial or purposclul synthesis oi natural toxins). easier discrinunation in photo-progranuned poly- merases, or lower secon(ksry structure.

To improve this process, several nucleotide analogues have been tested for their superiority over natural nucleotides in TdT-based DNA synthesis.

These linkers are designed with chemically reactive segments that can be cleaved by various agents including enzymes, light, heat, pH buffers, and redox reagents. This allows for the pre-fabrication of solid-phase reactive reservoirs of solution-phase primers for specific features, which can be released into solution for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) upon cleavage.\n\n2. **Electrolysis for Generating Acids and Bases**: The application of an electric current through an electrolyte can lead to the oxidative generation of acids at the anode and the reductive generation of bases at the cathode, a process exemplified by water electrolysis. The text mentions reactions at both electrodes and how adding easily oxidized molecules, like Hydroquinone, to the electrolyte can enhance acid production at the anode.\n\n3. **Use of Hydroquinone**: Hydroquinone (and its derivatives) inclusion in the electrolyte is highlighted as a means to facilitate and enhance acid generation at the anode.

Each reaction mixture was incubated for 15 minutes before being loaded onto a TBE-Urea gel for analysis, along with an unextended initiator for comparison.\n\nThe findings from the gel electrophoresis indicate that TdT enzyme activity can be modulated by pH levels. Specifically, TdT is highly active within a pH range of 6 to 11, but its activity significantly decreases outside this range\u2014below pH 6 and above pH 11. The experiment further demonstrates that this effect of pH on TdT activity is reversible; the enzyme can be inactivated by shifting the pH to unfavorable levels (either too acidic or too alkaline) and then reactivated by adjusting the pH back to within the 6-11 range. This reversible modulation of TdT activity by pH was illustrated through specific examples in the gel electrophoresis results, showing little to no enzyme activity at starting pH levels of 6 and 11, but restored activity when the pH was adjusted to more favorable levels.\n\nOverall, the study establishes that pH can be effectively used to control the activity of the TdT enzyme in a reversible manner, suggesting potential applications for data storage or other biotechnological processes where precise control of enzymatic activity is required.###_### us10745814": ["zo\n\n3 Both parts of each reaction were incubated for 15 muiutes. they lucre then mixed to form the 20 pl total. then loaded on a TBE-Urea gck\n\nAs shown in ill(i. 3, 1'dT is hi ably active in pl I ranges that are above 6 and belolv 11, mid it is substantially inactivated atpH ran es thatare below 6 andabove 11.

The process relies on the use of cathode and anode samples to initiate polymerization of DNA strands through the activation of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a template-independent DNA polymerase. The cathode samples do not show any extension of DNA strands since no significant pH drop occurs that would activate TdT. Conversely, the anode samples demonstrate extension due to an electrically-induced pH change which activates TdT, allowing for polymerization. Samples labeled AC, which contain DNA initiators placed at the junction between the anode and cathode, show mixed results with some showing extension (indicating activation at the anode side) and some not, illustrating that extension with TdT is localized only to the anode area. This principle is proposed for use in a massively parallel synthesis approach for DNA, utilizing electrically addressable electrodes to control the activation of TdT via pH changes.

The method comprises two main steps:\n\n1. **Combining Components in an Electrolyte Media:** The process begins with mixing a selected nucleotide triphosphate with one or more cations and an error-prone or template-independent DNA polymerase in an aqueous electrolyte media. This mixture is placed at a reaction site that includes an initiator sequence to which the nucleotide is to be added. Importantly, the reaction site is kept at an inactivating pH that prevents the polymerase from adding the nucleotide to the initiator sequence. This inactivation ensures that the polymerase does not act prematurely or in an uncontrolled manner. The reaction site is part of a reaction zone that contains an electrode of an electrochemical cell; this electrode can function as either an anode or a cathode.\n\n2. **Applying Voltage or Current to Activate the Polymerase:** The next step involves applying a voltage or current to the electrochemical cell associated with each reaction zone. This application of electrical energy generates an acid or a base in the aqueous electrolyte media at the reaction zone, which in turn alters the pH at this location. The pH is adjusted to an \"activating pH\" that activates the error-prone polymerase or template-independent DNA polymerase, enabling it to add the selected nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence. This step allows for precise control over the polymerase's activity, enabling the targeted addition of nucleotides to synthesize the desired polynucleotide sequence.\n\nThe patent (US 10,745,814 B2) outlines a sophisticated method that leverages electrochemical cells to control the environment of the DNA polymerization reaction precisely. By adjusting the pH through electrochemical means, the method allows for the controlled activation of the polymerase, ensuring that nucleotides are added to the growing polynucleotide chain in a controlled and precise manner. This approach offers potential advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency in synthesizing polynucleotides, which are crucial for various applications in biotechnology and molecular biology.###_### us10745814": ["cagtcagatc ggaagagcac acgtctgaac tccagtca\n\n3 ~\n\n55\n\npH that renders the ermr prone or template independent DNA polymemqse inactive to add the selected nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence. and wherein each I'0;lctlon site Ls lvlthul a cori'esponlhng I'cacthul zilne lnchlrl- ing ml cleclrodc ol a corresponding ehmlrochcmical cell whermn thc clcctrode ls an anode or a cathode of thc electrochemical cell thereby providing a plurality ofreaction zones snd a plurahly of corrcspondulg clectrochmnlcal cells, (b) applying separate voltages to each of thc corresponding clctxrochcmicsl cells to generate an selt) or a base in the ss aqueous electrollae media at the corresponding, reaction zone to alter pi I in the corresponding reaction zone to create\n\nThe invention claimed is: 1 A method fhr making 0 polynucleotlde comprising (aj combining a selected nucleotide triphosphate, one or more cations, and an error pmne polymerase or tem- plate indtqicndent DNA polymerase ul aqueous clcc- lrolytc mcdla al a renclion elle lncludulg an ulilialor sequence attached thereto and having a y terminal nucleonic,\n\nwhcrcul the reacnon sile is at an ulacuvatlng pH lhal rmldcrs the error prone polymcrasc or lcmplalc inde- pendent l)NA polymerase inactive to add the selected nucleotide triphosphate to the initiator sequence, and\n\nUS 10,745,814 B2\n\n23 v;hcrchl Ihc rcacnon site ls wlthul d lcdcllon zone ulclUd- ing an electmde of an electrochemical cell wherein the clcctrodc is au anode or a cathode of Ihe eleclrochenu- cal cell,\n\n(b) dpplyulg voltugc or current to the electrochemical cell to enerate an ac&d or a base in the aqueous electrolyte media at the reaction zone to alter pH in the reaction zone to create an activating pi I to activate the error prone polymerase or template independent DNA poly- nlcrB sc,\n\n10###_### us10745814"], "The text outlines a detailed method related to DNA polymerization, specifically focusing on the use of an error-prone DNA polymerase or a template-independent terminal deoxynucleotide transferase.

A cleavable moiety is a chemical group that can be easily removed or broken off, suggesting that this method allows for the temporary attachment of some initiating molecule to the polynucleotide, which can later be cleaved or detached.\n\n2. **Release of Polynucleotide Following Nucleotide Addition (Claim 40):** This claim elaborates on releasing the polynucleotide from the reaction site after a desired sequence of nucleotides has been added. This suggests a step-wise or controlled addition of nucleotides to the polynucleotide, followed by its release from a specific site where the reaction occurs.\n\n3. **Use of Enzyme, Chemical, Light, or Heat for Releasing Polynucleotide (Claim 41):** The method includes releasing the polynucleotide from the reaction site using an enzyme, a chemical cleavage, light, or heat. This implies versatility in the method, allowing for different approaches to detach the polynucleotide from the reaction site depending on the conditions or requirements of the experiment.\n\n4. **Collection, Amplification, and Sequencing of Polynucleotide (Claim 42):** After releasing the polynucleotide, the method involves collecting the polynucleotide, amplifying it (increasing its quantity), and sequencing it (determining the order of nucleotides). This indicates that the method is concerned with not just the synthesis of polynucleotides but also with analyzing them post-synthesis.\n\n5. **Removal and Provision of Reaction Reagents (Claim 43):** This claim mentions the removal of one or more reaction reagents from the reaction site and the provision of additional reaction reagents after each round of nucleotide addition. This suggests a controlled and cyclical process of adding nucleotides to the polynucleotide, with adjustments to the reaction conditions or components at each step.\n\n6. **Multiple Reaction Sites (Claim 44):** The method includes having a plurality of reaction sites, each within a defined area (possibly indicated by \"reaction###_###\"). This could imply that the method allows for parallel processing or simultaneous synthesis of multiple polynucleotides under similar or varying conditions.\n\nOverall, the text outlines a detailed and versatile method for attaching initiators to polynucleotides, adding nucleotides in a controlled manner, releasing the polynucleotides, and then collecting, amplifying, and sequencing them. The method appears to be adaptable, with provisions for using different means to release the polynucleotides and for managing reaction conditions and reagents throughout the process.###_### us10745814": ["NH\n\nviph Th I dr'TP\n\n0\n\n59\n\n39.

This method involves several key steps and components, organized within an electrochemical system designed to facilitate specific biochemical reactions.\n\n1. **Electrode Configuration**: The method utilizes a setup where each reaction site is associated with an electrode within an electrochemical cell. These electrodes can either be an anode or a cathode. The system is designed so that each reaction site is contained within its own reaction zone, each corresponding to a specific electrochemical cell. This setup allows for the independent control of reactions at each site by applying separate voltages or currents to each cell.\n\n2. **Reaction Control**: The application of separate voltages or currents is crucial for generating an acid or base in the aqueous electrolyte media at each corresponding reaction zone. This alteration in pH is what activates the error-prone polymerase or template-independent DNA polymerase at each site. The independent control mechanism ensures that reactions can be initiated or halted as needed at each site, allowing for precise manipulation of the biochemical processes.\n\n3. **Reagent Delivery and Reaction Initiation**: The method includes the delivery of one or more reaction reagents to each of the plurality of reaction sites. These reagents include a selected nucleotide triphosphate, cations, and an error-prone polymerase or template-independent DNA polymerase, mixed in aqueous electrolyte media. The conditions are set such that when a selected nucleotide triphosphate is added to the initiator sequence, it becomes a terminal nucleotide, allowing for the sequential addition of nucleotides to form polynucleotides.\n\n4. **Process Repetition for Polynucleotide Synthesis**: The steps of combining selected nucleotide triphosphates with other components at each site, altering the pH to activate the polymerase, and thereby adding the nucleotide to the growing polynucleotide chain, are repeated. This process continues until the desired polynucleotides are formed.\n\nIn summary, US 10,745,814 B2 describes an advanced method for the synthesis of polynucleotides using a system of independently controlled electrochemical cells. Each cell has its own reaction zone and electrode (anode or cathode) for precise control over the biochemical reactions. The method hinges on the ability to independently adjust the conditions (such as pH) at each reaction site via the application of separate voltages or currents, facilitating the desired nucleotide polymerization reactions.###_### us10745814": ["NFR\n\nUS 10,745,814 B2\n\n29 zone including an clectrodc of an elcctrochcmmal cell wherein the electrode is an anode or a cathode of the electrochemical cell and wherein addition of a nucleotide triphosphate at each of the plumllity of reaction sites Is independently controlled by sepamste application of voltages tor culzcnts,\n\n45.

If it's a date, it represents January 2006. If it's a classification code, it could be related to a specific category in a patent classification system.\n   - **(2018.01)**: Similar to the above, this could represent January 2018, indicating another significant point in time possibly related to the patent. If it's a classification code, it would denote another category or update.\n   - **(200G.01)**: This appears three times and does not conform to a recognizable date format, suggesting it might be a specific classification code or an error in the table. If it's a code, it likely denotes a particular category or aspect relevant to the patent.\n   - **(201 8 01)**: This seems to be a typographical error for (2018.01), again referring to January 2018.\n\n2. **Patent Number:**\n   - **us10745814**: This is a United States patent number. The format indicates it is a patent granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The number can be used to look up the patent document, which will provide detailed information about an invention, including its description, claims, and legal status.\n\n**Detailed Summary:**\nThe table appears to juxtapose dates or classification codes (possibly indicating significant events or categorizations related to a patent) against a specific patent number, us10745814. The repeated references to January 2006 and January 2018 could indicate important dates in the lifecycle of the patent, such as filing, publication, or grant dates. The \"200G.01\" entry, mentioned three times, is ambiguous without additional context but could represent a specific aspect or classification relevant to the patent's content or technology field.\n\nThe presence of the patent number (us10745814) suggests that the table's primary purpose is to relate these dates or classification codes to this specific patent, possibly highlighting its development, classification changes, or other significant milestones over time.\n\nFor a more accurate and comprehensive understanding, one would need to look up the patent using its number at the USPTO database or a similar patent repository.
