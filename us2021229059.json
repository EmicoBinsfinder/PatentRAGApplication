Despite advancements in high throughput DNA sequencing techniques like Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS), which have significantly reduced the cost of genome sequencing, the field of de novo DNA synthesis has not progressed as rapidly. The traditional method for de novo DNA synthesis is a multi-step process that includes synthesizing small oligonucleotide pools, verifying the sequences of these small fragments, assembling these fragments to create a complete DNA sequence, and finally, verifying the complete sequence. This process relies on direct phosphoramidite chemistry, which has significant error rates and limits the practical size of the oligonucleotides that can be synthesized.\n\nThe text highlights that while existing DNA synthesis technologies have been used for constructing viral genomes and yeast chromosomal arms, the process becomes increasingly difficult and costly as the length of the DNA chain increases. For example, using one of the most cost-effective methods at $1 per 1,000 base pairs, synthesizing a whole human genome (approximately 3 billion base pairs) would cost over $3 million, which is over 3,000 times more expensive than sequencing an entire human genome. More realistic estimates, including assembly costs, could raise the cost to between $100 million and $1 billion, with a turnaround time of several years. The inefficiency and high cost of current de novo DNA synthesis methods, with assembly rates of about 1 base pair per minute, make the synthesis of large genomes impractical.###_### us2021229059": ["BACKGROUND\n\n[0003] Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules are the carriers of genetic information of all known livin orgm&- isms and go& crn the&r growth, development, funct&o&un and reproducuon In riocnt years, advances u& the (icld of gcni&nues have kxl to contuluous hap&oven&cut of h&gh throughput DNA sequencmg techniques, e g..

This innovation involves systems, devices, and methods that facilitate the electronic manipulation of polymerase enzymes to synthesize DNA. While the primary focus is on DNA synthesis, the principles and techniques described are adaptable for other applications, including RNA synthesis.\n\nThe core of the disclosed technology is a method for synthesizing a nucleotide chain, which includes an ordered series of nucleotides. This method involves using electronically modulated electrodes to control a polymerase enzyme. The process starts with identifying a first nucleotide and controlling the polymerase enzyme to attach it to the nucleotide chain. Subsequent nucleotides are identified and added in order, with the polymerase enzyme assembling each new nucleotide onto the chain under the guidance of electrically modulated electrodes.\n\nAdditionally, the disclosure includes a system designed to implement this method. This system comprises an electrode, a polymerase enzyme immobilized next to the electrode, and a processor coupled with a memory. The memory holds instructions which, when executed by the processor, direct the electronic modulation of the electrode. This modulation, in turn, guides the polymerase enzyme in assembling the nucleotide chain from an ordered sequence of nucleotides. The instructions further enable the processor to identify and add nucleotides to the growing chain, maintaining the sequence's order.\n\nFurthermore, the text describes a non-transitory computer-readable medium that contains program instructions for performing the nucleotide chain synthesis method. This involves electronically modulating an electrode to control the polymerase enzyme in assembling the nucleotide chain, beginning with the identification of the first nucleotide and continuing with subsequent nucleotides until the chain is complete.\n\nIn summary, the disclosed technology presents a novel approach to DNA synthesis, emphasizing electronic control over polymerase enzymes to streamline the process, reduce costs, and increase speed. This approach is not limited to DNA synthesis but can be extended to other fields, such as RNA synthesis, showcasing its versatility and potential for broad application.###_### us2021229059": ["Jul. 29, 2021\n\n[0005] Thus. there is an unmet need for improvementc to dc novo DNA synthesis that reduce the cost and increase spccd.

This technology involves the use of a polymerase enzyme, specifically a template-independent DNA polymerase, which is immobilized near an electrode. By applying electric modulation, such as varying voltage biasing of the electrode, the polymerase enzyme can be controlled to construct selectable or programmable strands of nucleic acids, potentially up to and including entire genomes.\n\nThe polymerase can be immobilized by bonding it to a surface of a microelectrode or attaching it to the electrode with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. It's also mentioned that multiple polymerase enzymes can be bonded to respective electrodes in a microelectrode array, allowing for the parallel construction of multiple nucleic acid strands. This method is highlighted as significantly faster than traditional chemical synthesis methods, with polymerases assembling base pairs at speeds approximately 1000 base pairs per second (bp/s), which is over 10,000 times faster than chemical synthesis. This means a single polymerase could assemble a 3 billion base pair DNA strand in a matter of weeks, as opposed to years using previous methods.\n\nThe text underscores several advantages of this technology over existing methods. These include improved methods of DNA synthesis which could serve as fundamental tools for genetic studies, such as constructing knockout genetic libraries for human cell lines, facilitating understanding of structural and functional characteristics of regulatory sequences, and delineating their roles in transcriptional and other regulatory processes. Additionally, it mentions the potential for low-cost, rapid DNA synthesis to enable rational protein design, study of protein structure-function relationships, engineering new protein functionalities, vaccines, and antibiotics.

This is useful for applications such as chemical production or cell-based chemical sensing. One key development highlighted is the de novo synthesis of DNA at genome-level complexity, allowing for complete control over an organism's genetic code. This capability facilitates the rational design and synthesis of viral and bacterial genomes, and the use of DNA for creating complex 2D and 3D structures needed in new materials, therapeutics, and even for information processing and computation.\n\nThe text also mentions the potential of de novo DNA synthesis for DNA-based high-density data storage and archiving, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of long-sequence DNA synthesis. Although the discussion initially centers on the use of a DNA polymerase (specifically a template-independent type like Taq polymerase) for these technologies, it clarifies that the disclosed techniques could similarly apply to RNA polymerases.\n\nAn example implementation of the technology involves a planar electrode platform designed for immobilizing an enzyme (such as a polymerase) near an electrode, which can be modulated electrically to control the enzyme's activity. This setup uses biotin-streptavidin links or PEG chains to secure the polymerase, allowing it to adjust based on electric modulation. By controlling the power supplied to the electrode, the functioning of the polymerase can be directed, enabling the design and synthesis of DNA strands by choosing the next nucleotide to be added through electric modulation.

LCP is highlighted as a suitable substrate material due to its high interfacial adhesion and low moisture absorption, which are beneficial for the long-term viability of micro-electrodes on LCP substrates.\n\nThe electronic array chip described can individually or simultaneously control the biasing voltage for each electrode. The electrode array includes cells, each with an electrode that may be similar to others mentioned in the document. Power supplied to these electrodes creates a programmable biasing electric field, modulating the activity of polymerase enzymes connected to specific electrodes. Moreover, some electrodes can switch between acting as a voltage source or ground to further modify the electric field. In certain instances, light sources, such as lasers, may be directed towards the electrodes to provide optical modulation, offering an alternative or additional means to modify polymerase activity.\n\nA specific embodiment features an electrode array platform comprising a substrate, electrodes, and bio-links. Polymerase enzymes are connected to the bio-links, and a programmable biasing electrical field controls the enzymes. Although typically a single enzyme is attached to multiple points on a single electrode, there can be variations. For example, multiple enzymes might be attached to a single electrode to facilitate the simultaneous creation of multiple DNA strands or fragments. Conversely, a single enzyme could be surrounded by multiple electrodes to achieve more precise control over the desired DNA strand production.\n\nLastly, the text outlines a method for creating the electrode platform, which involves plating an electrode with gold, possibly through electroless gold plating.

Initially, a layer of gold is deposited on the electrode, serving as an inert surface to prevent any unintended chemical reactions that might occur, particularly with the polymerase enzyme and any additional layers applied to the electrode. Following the gold deposition, the electrode is coated with silica nanoparticles. This coating process involves using a self-assembled monolayer of (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane. The monolayer acts as a seeding layer, which is essential for the subsequent deposition of a thin-film sol-gel silica layer and/or an organosilane layer.

This silica-coated surface is then functionalized (referred to as functionalized 430 in the text) by attaching bio-links, using biotin PEG silane to facilitate the attachment process. This process not only prepares the electrode surface for enzyme attachment but also establishes bio-links (referred to as bio-links 120) essential for the subsequent immobilization of polymerase enzymes (referred to as polymerase 130).\n\nThe polymerase is then immobilized (referred to as immobilized 440) onto the treated electrode surface through a biotinylation process, which involves attaching the polymerase to the electrode via the bio-links established in the previous step. This step is crucial for the intended DNA synthesis as it ensures the polymerase enzymes are properly positioned and attached to the electrode's surface.\n\nThe text further mentions that the described method of creating the electrode platform and immobilizing polymerase is just one example, indicating the existence of various alternative techniques for achieving the same goal. Additionally, it highlights the importance of proper enzyme binding, noting that improper binding can lead to inhibitory activities which can affect the electrode\u2019s sensing capabilities. This includes issues such as a decrease in surface Debye length due to attached molecules and non-specific binding that can disrupt the proper orientation of enzyme molecules, thereby degrading their activities and functionalities after immobilization.\n\nTo ensure effective DNA synthesis, the text introduces a flowchart (referred to as flowchart 500) outlining a method for de novo DNA synthesis. This method begins with initiating DNA synthesis (referred to as initiating 510), which may involve controlling the enzyme through electrical modulation. Following this, a processor is used to identify a first nucleotide in a DNA strand (identified 520). The electrode is then adjusted to modulate (referred to as modulated 530) the polymerase, enabling the addition of the identified nucleotide to the DNA strand. This process involves adjusting the voltage biasing of the electrode to facilitate the attachment of different bases to the end of the DNA strand, underscoring a precise and controlled approach to DNA synthesis facilitated by the electrode and its surface treatment.\n\nOverall, the text outlines a sophisticated method for preparing an electrode surface for DNA synthesis, emphasizing the importance of proper enzyme immobilization and the controlled addition of nucleotides to a DNA strand through electrical modulation of polymerase enzymes.###_### us2021229059": ["3\n\nJul. 29, 2021\n\n[0033] The silica-coated surface of electrode 110 is then liincttnnalrznl 430 by auaching bio-links to thereto.
