Despite advancements in DNA sequencing technologies, such as Next-Generation-Sequencing (NGS), which have significantly reduced costs, the synthesis of DNA from scratch has not seen similar progress. Traditional de novo DNA synthesis involves a multi-step process including synthesizing small oligonucleotide fragments, verifying these fragments, assembling these into a complete DNA sequence, and then validating the entire sequence. This process heavily relies on phosphoramidite chemistry, but it faces challenges due to high error rates in oligo fragment synthesis and limitations in the practical size of the oligos created. These challenges result in high costs and long turnaround times for synthesizing large genomes, such as the human genome, which could cost between $100 million to $1 billion and take several years.

Specifically, it introduces a method for constructing a nucleotide chain (which comprises a sequence of nucleotides) through the controlled assembly of nucleotides by a polymerase enzyme. This process is directed by the electrical modulation of an electrode which influences the enzyme's activity.\n\nThe method begins with identifying the first nucleotide in the sequence to be assembled and using an electrode's electrical modulation to control the polymerase enzyme to attach this nucleotide onto the growing nucleotide chain. This process is repeated for each subsequent nucleotide identified as the \"current\" one to be added, with the polymerase enzyme assembling it onto the chain under the guidance of electrically modulated signals from the electrode.\n\nThe system designed to implement this method includes an electrode positioned adjacent to the immobilized polymerase enzyme, a processor, and a memory unit. The memory stores instructions that, when executed by the processor, direct the electrical modulation of the electrode. This modulation, in turn, controls the activity of the polymerase enzyme in assembling the nucleotide chain, starting from identifying and attaching the first nucleotide and proceeding through to each subsequent nucleotide in the sequence.\n\nAdditionally, the technology encompasses a non-transitory computer-readable medium that contains program instructions for executing the described method of nucleotide chain synthesis. This encompasses the steps of identifying the initial nucleotide, controlling the polymerase enzyme through electrode modulation to assemble this and subsequent nucleotides onto the nucleotide chain.\n\nIn essence, this technology offers a novel approach to DNA and potentially RNA synthesis by precisely controlling the assembly of nucleotide chains through electrical signals, which regulate the activity of polymerase enzymes in a sequence-defined manner.###_### us2021229059": ["SUMMARY\n\n[0006] The disclosed technofo~ pmvides systems, dcviccs, and methods for electron&c marupulat&on of poly- merasc for DNA synthcs&s.

The technology involves immobilizing a polymerase enzyme, such as a template-independent DNA polymerase, near an electrode. By applying electric modulation to the electrode (e.g., varying voltage bias), the polymerase can be controlled to synthesize selectable or programmable strands of nucleic acids, including DNA or RNA, potentially up to an entire genome. This process is made possible by bonding the polymerase to a microelectrode surface or linking it to the electrode with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. Furthermore, by utilizing a microelectrode array where multiple polymerase enzymes are bonded to respective electrodes, parallel construction of numerous nucleic acid strands can be achieved.\n\nPolymerase enzymes naturally assemble base pairs at a speed significantly faster than chemical synthesis methods, about 1000 base pairs per second, which is over 10,000 times the speed of current chemical synthesis techniques. This means that a single polymerase could assemble a full 3 billion base pair DNA strand in weeks, as opposed to years with existing methods. Accelerating DNA synthesis further, multiple polymerases can work in parallel to synthesize DNA fragments for later assembly.\n\nThe disclosed technology presents several advantages over existing methods, such as providing a new, fundamental tool for genetic studies, constructing comprehensive genetic libraries, facilitating the understanding of structural and functional characteristics of regulatory sequences, and aiding in the study of transcriptional and other regulatory processes in various biological systems. Additionally, it offers low-cost, rapid DNA synthesis which can support rational protein design, the study of protein structure-function relationships, the engineering of new protein functionalities, vaccines, and antibiotics. Large-scale de novo DNA synthesis, as described, could significantly expedite the design-build-test cycles in genetic and molecular research, presenting a considerable advancement over current techniques.###_### us2021229059": ["BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FICTURES\n\n[(R)IUJ Reference &vill nov be made to the accompanying I&1gufcc. which al'c I'Iot access;O'll)'&dwu to scale,;uxi wherein: [UUH] FI(i platform according to an example embodiment [(R)12J FI(i 2 illustrates an electronic arraychip according to an example embodiment\n\nUS 202 [/0229059 A[\n\n[0013] lornl according to tin cnlbodinlcnn [0014] electrode platforni 100 according to an embodiment.

Two primary types of electrode array platforms are introduced: one based on a Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) and the other on a Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The LCP is highlighted for its biocompatibility, high interfacial adhesion, and low moisture absorption, enhancing the long-term viability of micro-electrodes on LCP substrates.\n\nThe electrode array, identified as chip 200, allows for precise control of biasing voltage to each electrode, which can be adjusted individually or in parallel. The array consists of cells, each containing an electrode, either type 100 or 225, with the capability to generate a programmable biasing electric field. This field modulates the activity of a polymerase enzyme connected to an electrode, with the possibility of further modulation by selectively altering the voltage source or ground of electrode 225. Additionally, optical modulation using light sources, such as lasers directed towards the electrode, can be employed to modify the enzyme's operation.\n\nA specific embodiment is described (FIG. 3) where the electrode platform includes a substrate, an electrode, bio-links, and a polymerase enzyme. The arrangement allows for the programmable control of the polymerase enzyme via an electrical field, facilitating the creation of DNA strands or fragments. The design can accommodate multiple enzymes attached to a single electrode or a single enzyme controlled by multiple electrodes to enhance precision in DNA synthesis.\n\nThe manufacturing process of the electrode platform is outlined, starting with the plating of an electrode with gold through an electroless process, potentially followed by a secondary plating step for thickening the gold layer. This gold layer serves as an inert surface to prevent unintended chemical reactions. Subsequently, the gold-plated electrode is coated with silica nanoparticles through a self-assembled monolayer process, which may involve (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane, serving as a seeding layer for further thin-film sol-gel silica and/or organosilane layers.\n\nThe summary encapsulates the innovative aspects of the described biocompatible electrode array platforms, emphasizing their potential in precisely controlling biochemical processes at the microscale through both electrical and optical modulation methods, and detailing the careful materials and methods chosen to ensure biocompatibility and functionality of the electrodes.###_### us2021229059": ["examples\u201ea biocompatible liquid crystal polymer (LCP)- based board-level elcctrodc array or a Complementary mctal~xidc semiconductor (CMOS)-based mte rated circuit (I(')-level electmde arnly One of ordinary skill will recognize that I,('P is a bincompatible substrate niatenal lvith high interfacial adhesion and a low degree of moisnue absorption. which enhances long-term viability of micro- electrodes on LCP substmstes.

The silica-coated surface of electrode 110 is functionalized by attaching bio-links, such as biotin PEG silane, which allows for the immobilization of polymerase enzymes on the electrode through a process called biotinylation. This setup is crucial for the subsequent steps in DNA synthesis. However, it is noted that improper binding of polymerase enzymes can inhibit the effective sensing capabilities of the electrode, possibly due to factors like decreased surface Debye length and non-specific binding that can misorient the enzyme molecules, thereby degrading their activity and functionality post-immobilization.\n\nThe document outlines a method for de novo DNA synthesis, which involves initiating DNA synthesis possibly by controlling the polymerase through electrical modulation to start building a DNA strand, such as a telomere. The process includes identifying the first nucleotide to be added to the DNA strand, adjusting the electrode to modulate the polymerase activity to add the identified nucleotide, and repeating the process for additional nucleotides until the DNA synthesis is complete. This completion might also involve controlling the polymerase to cap the DNA strand with a telomere.\n\nFurthermore, the text mentions the possibility of creating multiple DNA fragments either sequentially using the same electrode or in parallel using multiple electrodes. These fragments can be assembled into a complete DNA strand, potentially accelerating the assembly process compared to existing methods. DNA synthesis could also occur in a solution containing nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) and magnesium chloride, among other components, which might include a reaction buffer and corresponding dNTPs.\n\nThis summary is based on US Patent Application US2021229059.###_### us2021229059": ["[0033] The silica-coated surface of electrode 110 is then liincttnnalrznl 430 by auaching bio-links to thereto.
